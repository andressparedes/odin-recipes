    <h2>The best way to start the day</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</p>
